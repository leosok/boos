Boos library and cli
====================


A python library and cli for the `Bose SoundTouch (R) API <http://products.bose.com/api-developer/index.html>`_.

To be able to use my Bose Soundtouch 10 from the command line.

And to be able to use it as library for Home-Assistant https://home-assistant.io/

And to be 'my first pip' package :-)

As an alternative have a look at https://github.com/chassing/badtouch
